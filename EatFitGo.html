            <h3 class="no_padding">I'm a website designer</h3>
            <p>I'm a inquisitive person, so web design is something that I've taken to very quickly.  I've really fallen in love with the logic puzzles that are back end programming, and getting the finishing touch on a front end is akin to finally getting your room <i>just</i> the way you like it.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> Interests</h3>
            <p>I Have an abiding curiosity about the complicated and anything I can dig wayyy too deep into.  I am passionate about music, animals/nature, books, complicated boardgames and watching sports.  Human beings are probably my greatest source of enjoyment, however, as good friends and good conversation really make my life worth living.  Basically I'm an investigative, thoughtful person who's good to work with.</p>

            <h3 class="no_padding">What I've done</h3>
            <p> My work as a programmer has been mainly focused on creating websites that increase traffic and revenue for my clients, but that process has done a lot for me.  It has allowed me to explore multiple languages, create a wide range of programs, and develop a much more nuanced problem solving process.  This is built on a base of skills that I already possessed from past work experiences that make me a much more well rounded coder.  Particularly helpful has been persnicketinous gained from working in science for a number of years,  perseverance from keeping the front end at a run down grocery store functioning, and an ability to think and move quickly bred from making sandwiches at lightning speed while drunks looked on menacingly.  </p>

            <h3 class="no_padding">You're a Growing Company...</h3>
            <p>And your website needs to be the perfect extension of your company to keep that growth going.  A website that embodies your company helps drive interest and revenue, so having the right people as caretakers of that on line presence can be the difference between unabated growth and hitting an artificial cap.

            People who believe in the vision and growth of Eat Fit Go.  I fit that bill. I have not only the have the shared ideals but also command of the languages involved to be a great developer, either front end, back end or both.  I also bring to the table a general flexibility that allows me to dream up innovative solutions to problems that inevitably arise.  This is augmented by my commitment to segmented, understandable code.  Preventing code sprawl has been a large part of my development as a coder, so some section of my thought is always focused on creating more efficient passages.  Noticing the marked improvements this has brought in both the functionality and understandability of my code pushed me towards a breakthrough:  Code is not only composed of procedural languages, but is a language in and of itself, one that is most fluent when spoken
            with preciseness and brevity.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> How this can help</h3>
            <p>
            Good back end code has a logic to it.  A fires B which sets the stage for C which triggers D at just the right point. Getting to the point where it is this simple to explain your code out loud is a victory in and of itself for me.  A structurally sound back end removes impediments for front end coding, allowing it to become an exercise of creativity, rather than a minefield of potential conflicts.</p>
