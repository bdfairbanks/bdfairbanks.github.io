            <h3 class="no_padding">I'm a Website Designer</h3>
            <p>I'm a inquisitive person, so web design is something that I've taken to very quickly.  I've really fallen in love with the logic puzzles that are back end programming, and getting the finishing touch on a front end is akin to finally getting your room <i>just</i> the way you like it.  Combining these two to create something new is a rush, the coding itself is a series of victories and  seeing the end product creates a profound feeling of accomplishment.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> Interests</h3>
            <p>I Have an abiding curiosity about the complicated and anything I can dig wayyy too deep into.  I am passionate about music, animals/nature, books, and watching sports.  Human beings are probably my greatest source of enjoyment, however, as good friends and good conversation really make my life worth living.  These traits translate into the workforce as affability and an interest in tackling the thorny problems that no one else wants to touch.  I enjoy being the workhorse of the group, and try to help those around me both enjoy what they are doing and excel at doing it.</p>

            <h3 class="no_padding">What I've done</h3>
            <p> My work as a programmer has been mainly focused on creating websites that increase traffic and revenue for my clients, but that process has done a lot for me.  It has allowed me to explore multiple languages, create a wide range of programs, and develop a much more nuanced problem solving process.  This is built on a base of skills that I already possessed from past work experiences that make me a much more well rounded coder.  Particularly helpful has been persnicketinous gained from working in science for a number of years,  perseverance from keeping the front end at an always changing grocery store functioning, and an ability to think and move quickly bred from making operating in high pressure environments.</p>

            <p> And this commitment to creativity combined with a forward thinking mindset has resulted in a company able to tackle the web in all it's aspects.  This aggressively omnivorous approach to marketing has translated to the flexibility to meet the needs of a wide array of clients and an the potential for an intriguing portfolio that any ambitious developer would want to work on.

            <p> 
            People who believe in the vision and growth of Antidote 71 and have the resourcefulness and determination to make a difference.  I fit that bill. I have not only the have the passion but also command of the languages involved to be a great developer at Antidote 71.  I also bring to the table a general flexibility that allows me to dream up innovative solutions to problems that inevitably arise.  This is augmented by my commitment to segmented, understandable code.  Preventing code sprawl has been a large part of my development as a coder, so some section of my thought is always focused on creating more efficient passages.  Noticing the marked improvements this has brought in both the functionality and understandability of my code pushed me towards a breakthrough:  Code is not only composed of procedural languages, but is a language in and of itself, one that is most fluent when spoken with preciseness and brevity.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> How this can help</h3>
            <p>
            Good back end code has a logic to it. Getting this logic to the point where it is this simple to explainout loud is a victory in and of itself for me.  A structurally sound understanding of the back end removes impediments for front end coding, allowing it to become an exercise of creativity, rather than a minefield of potential conflicts.  This full stack thinking is helpful in all areas of coding, and will be a dynamic addition to your team.</p>
