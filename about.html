  <p>Here's a bit about me!</p>

  <p>Over the course of my life I have worked many different jobs, studied many things, and acquired a wide skill set. Through my efforts at each of these jobs, I have worked my way into positions of responsibility and authority, and striven to streamline, optimize and clarify the operations around me. For all this, however, I have never had anything which I would consider a career or want to do for the rest of my life. Coding is something that engages and energizes me, is something I would enjoy as a career, and is something I'd like to excel at. </p>
