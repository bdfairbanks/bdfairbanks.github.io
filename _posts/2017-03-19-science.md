One of the most valuble tools a programer has in thier toolkit is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">unit testing.</a> Unit tests consist of taking specific, important, high traffic portions of your program and running them in isolation.  This allows you to crystalize exactly what this section of your program does.  Ruby has a testing tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec" target="_blank">RSpec,</a> which I am most familiar with, but the basic idea can be transfered between languages. RSpec tests look like this:

Like looking at any new subset of coding, getting a handle on what this code does is a bit of a challenge.  However when noteaded properly, RSpec is at least chunked up into sections with labels that have a finite amount of jargon.  Setup, Exercise, Verify and Teardown are reasonably understandable, Setup creates the enviornment that the method being tested needs to run, Exercise runs the method that is the crux of the test, Verify compares what was produced to a set value,(basically what you expected to be produced) and teardown returns the enviorment to the state it was pre Setup.</p>
