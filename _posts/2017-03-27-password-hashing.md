<p class="article_para"> 
This article interested me for a couple of reasons.  Firstly it gives a good overview of the different approaches to password protection within both larger commercial and smaller, more personal websites.  It also did a good job of joining the debate over its subject manner, giving seemingly solid conclusions as to why the author came to their position.
