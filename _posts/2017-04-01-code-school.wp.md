This article is about surviving code school/bootcamp, but in reality it's about taking on a big, frightening task and winning.  In the case of code school this win doesn't come without costs; learning a new skill set quickly leaves little time for anything else.  This required focus produces a kind of code-monk attitude, just write your scripts, learn your languages, and everything else will kind of fall into place.  This, unfortunately is not how the world works. Bills still need to be paid, pets (and children, for that matter,) still need to be fed, and showering or feeding yourself should be done every so often.  Balancing these necessities with the overwhelming feeling that unless you are writing code you are wasting time is tough, but there are several steps and methods that you can do to try to create a more harmonious balance.

Perhaps unsurprising, some of the most important work needs to be done before class even begins.  Preparation is key, and before you can prepare you need to understand what you are signing yourself up for.  A good code school will explain what kind of time and mental demands are in store for you.  Believe every last word they say.  Coding is about to become your singular focus in life, essentially replacing whatever you may have thought of as important beforehand.  It's a cult basically, though emerging with a useful skill set is a much better thing than being left with a criminal record and a shaved head.  Even with these guidelines in hand do some research on your own.  Find ways to gather information about what life is really like within the code school bubble and adjust your outlook accordingly.  Taking this large task seriously is the first step to the process.

Part of this preparatory period should include an honest and deep look at your life and creating a plan to meet your basic responsibilities while throwing what you have into code.  Forming an understanding of what actually constitutes indispensable responsibilities is a good place to start.  I can't really give you any advice here, it's pretty much just use your best judgment.  However, with these indispensable responsibilities form a subsection that you can take care of before class starts, and get it done.  Then plan out time every week to take care of the other stuff.  Yes, your life is now coding with a dash of responsibilities, rather than being responsibilities with a dash of fun.  It's kinda brutal.

Speaking of responsibilities, it's a good idea to keep some cash in the bank account.  That's gunna be hard.  Now it's time to form a list of extravagances.  Cut it out.  Cut it all out.  Even if you plan wisely, even if you have a really good handle on how much you think you're going to need, somethings going to come up.  When something comes up, a broken water heater, new tires on the car, (maybe you could sell your car? No? Just checking.) life finds a way to make things interesting.  You're going to be stressed enough just trying to learn all the skills you're going to need to grab that pot of decent jobs at the end of the code school rainbow, adding financial stress would be unpleasant, to say the least.

Now that you've given yourself a decent foundation, remember to treat yourself every once in a while during class.  Everything is hard, the first few weeks are rough, jobs are not guaranteed and you'll question your abilities at least a few times during class. Take a breath, treat yourself, and get back to work.  You got this.
