            <h3 class="no_padding">I'm a website designer</h3>
            <p>I'm a inquisitive person, so web design is something that I've taken to very quickly.  I've really fallen in love with the logic puzzles that are backend programming, and getting the finishing touch on a front end is akin to finally getting your room <i>just</i> the way you like it.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> Intrests(and why they are relevent)</h3>
            <p>I Have an abiding curiosity about the complicated and anything I can learn more about.  I am passionate about music, animals/nature, books, complicated boardgames and watching sports.  Human beings are probably my greatest source of enjoyment, however, as good friends and good coversation really make my life worth living. Wrapped up I'm a investigitive, thoughtful person who's good to work with.</p>

            <h3 class="no_padding">What I've done</h3>
            <p> My work as a coder has allowed me to explore multiple launguages, create a wide range of programs, and develop a much more nuanced problem solving process.  Outside of programing I've done many different things and picked up plenty of skills along the way.  These skills add specific traits that make me a much more well rounded coder.  I have  persnicityness from working in science for a number of years,  perservierence from keeping the front end at a run down grocery store functioning, and an ability to think and move quickly bred from making sandwitches at lightning speed while drunks looked on menacingly.  </p>

            <p> 
            More specifically you need me as an Infastructure Software Engineer.  I have not only the command of the languages involved but also a general flexability that allows me to dream up invotive solutions to problems that inevitably arrise.  Both of these things are augmented by my commitment to segmented code and comprehensive test models.  Preventing code sprawl has been a large part of my development as a coder, so some section of my thought is always focused on creating more effecient passages.  Noticing the marked inprovments this has brought in the understandibility of my code pushed me towards a breakthrough:  Code is not only composed of procedural languages, but is a language in and of itself, one that is most fluent when spoeken
            in preciseness and brevity.

            <h3 class="no_padding"> How this can help</h3>
            <p>
            Good code has a logic to it.  A fires B which sets the stage for C which triggers D at just the right point. Getting to the point where it is this simple to explain your code out loud is a victory in and of itself for me.
            Testing is an augmentation of this mantra.  Every stage of testing is helpful to the code refinement process.  The process of desigining a test almost always shows if a method is doing too much, the test set up allows you to find the precise limits of what your code can do and executing the tests can suggust potential uses for the method that perhaps where not apperent before.</p>
