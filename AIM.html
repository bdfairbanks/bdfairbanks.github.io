            <h4>I'm a website designer</h4>
            <p>I'm a inquisitive person, so web design is something that I've taken to very quickly.  I've really fallen in love with the logic puzzles that are backend programming, and getting the finishing touch on a front end is like completing a marathon. (I have to assume.  I've never run a marathon)</p>

            <h4> Intrests(and why they are relevent)</h4>
            <p>I Have an abiding intrest in the complicated and anything I can learn more about.  I have passionate  music, animals/nature, books, complicated boardgames and watching sportball.  Human beings are probably my greatest source of enjoyment, however as good friends and good coversation really make my life worth living. Wrapped up nicely I'm a investigitive, thoughtful person who's good with others.</p>

            <h4>What I've done</h4>
            <p> Throughout my life i've done a lot of different things and picked up plenty of skills around the way.  I have no job experience that directly translate to the computer science fields, but much that, scuffed around the edges adds complementery skills that make me a much more filled out coder.  I have the persnicityness of working in science for a number of years, the perservierence of keeping a front end at a run down grocery running, and the ability to think and move quickly breedd from making sandwitches at lightning speed while drunks looked on angrily.  </p>

            <h4>You need do-ers...</h4>
            <p> More specifically you need me as an Infastructure Software Engineer.  I have not only the command of the languages involved but also a general flexability that allows me to dream up invotive solutions to problems that inevitably arrise.  Both of these things are augmented by my commitment to segmented code and comprehensive test models.  Preventing code sprawl has been a large part of my development as a coder, so some section of my thought is always focused on creating more effecient passages.  Noticing the marked inprovments this has brought in the understandibility of my code pushed me towards a breakthrough:  Code is not only composed of procedural languages, but is a language in and of itself, one that is most fluent when spoeken in preciseness and brevity.  Good code has a logic to it.  A fires B which sets the stage for C which triggers D at just the right point. Getting to the point where it is simple to explain your code out loud is a victory in and of itself for me.
            Testing is an augmentation of this theory.  Every stage of testing is helpful to the code refinement process.  The process of desigining a test almost always shows if a method is doing too much, the test set up allows you to find the precise limits of what your code can do and executing the tests can suggust potential uses for the method that perhaps where not apperent before.</p>
